## v1.0.0

This release features a number of improvements and changes to this cookbook. In particular, things to watch out for include a new
data bag format, the ability to use Jetty instead of nginx for SSL, a modified Library API, and the removal of the `nexus::pro` recipe.

It is recommended that you configure your own cookbook to override some of the attributes defined in this cookbook and use the provided
LWRPs to customize your installation to your liking.
